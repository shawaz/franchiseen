# üö® Fix Production Error - Action Steps

## ‚úÖ Your Build is Working Locally

I tested your build and it compiles successfully! This means the error is **environment configuration**, not code.

---

## üéØ The Problem (Most Likely)

Your production deployment is failing because:

1. **Convex production URL is not set in Vercel**
2. **Or Convex production environment variables are missing**

---

## üîß Quick Fix - Do This Now

### Step 1: Get Your Convex Production URL

I'm opening your Convex dashboard now. Look for the production deployment URL.

**Or run this:**
```bash
npx convex dashboard --prod
```

This will open your Convex dashboard. Look at the top - you'll see a URL like:
```
https://magnificent-shark-123.convex.cloud
```

**Copy this entire URL!**

### Step 2: Add URL to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your `franchiseen` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Look for `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   
   **If it doesn't exist:**
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - Value: Paste your Convex URL from Step 1
   - Environment: **Production** ‚úÖ
   - Click "Save"

   **If it exists but is wrong:**
   - Click "Edit"
   - Update with correct production URL
   - Click "Save"

### Step 3: Set All Required Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel (Production environment):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-prod.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_WALLETS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
```

### Step 4: Set Convex Backend Secrets

```bash
# Generate and set authentication secret
npx convex env set AUTH_SECRET "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" --prod

# Generate and set wallet encryption key
npx convex env set WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY "$(openssl rand -hex 64)" --prod
```

### Step 5: Redeploy

After setting environment variables:

**Option A: Automatic Redeploy**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy with env vars"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Redeploy in Vercel**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for build to complete

---

## üîç Verify It's Fixed

After redeploying:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Visit your production URL**
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
4. **Test basic navigation:**
   - Homepage loads?
   - Can you navigate to other pages?
   - Any console errors?

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working

### Get Detailed Error Info:

1. **Open your production site**
2. **Press F12** to open DevTools
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Copy any red error messages**
5. **Send them to me**

### Check Vercel Deployment Status:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Look at latest deployment
4. What does it say?
   - ‚úÖ "Ready" = Deployed successfully
   - ‚ùå "Error" = Build failed
   - üîÑ "Building" = Still deploying

### Check Convex Deployment:

```bash
# Check if functions are deployed
npx convex logs --prod --tail

# Should show logs if deployment is active
```

## üìã Complete Verification Checklist

Run through this:

- [ ] Convex production deployed (`npx convex dashboard --prod` opens)
- [ ] Got Convex production URL (from dashboard)
- [ ] Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` to Vercel
- [ ] Set all other environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Set `AUTH_SECRET` in Convex prod
- [ ] Set `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in Convex prod
- [ ] Redeployed Vercel (push to main or manual redeploy)
- [ ] Waited for deployment to complete
- [ ] Site loads without "Application Error"

---

## üéØ Expected Result

After fixing, you should see:

‚úÖ Your homepage loads  
‚úÖ No "Application Error" page  
‚úÖ Can navigate to different pages  
‚úÖ No console errors (or only minor warnings)  

---

## üí° Pro Tip

To avoid this in future:

1. **Always test with production build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Set environment variables BEFORE first deploy**

3. **Use the same Convex URL** in both Convex and Vercel

---

Send me:
1. Screenshot of the error page
2. Browser console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
3. Vercel deployment status (Ready/Error?)
4. Your Convex production URL
