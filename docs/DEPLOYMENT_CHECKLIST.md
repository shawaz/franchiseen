# Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure smooth deployment to both environments.

---

## üìã Initial Setup (One Time)

### Convex Setup
- [ ] Create production Convex environment: `npx convex env add production`
- [ ] Deploy to production: `npx convex deploy --prod`
- [ ] Get production URL: `npx convex env get NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL --prod`
- [ ] Set production environment variables (see below)

### Convex Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
# Generate and set authentication secret
npx convex env set AUTH_SECRET "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" --prod

# Set wallet encryption key (CRITICAL FOR SECURITY)
npx convex env set WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY "$(openssl rand -hex 64)" --prod

# Set email API key (if using Resend)
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY "your-production-resend-key" --prod

# Set OpenAI key (if using AI features)
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY "your-production-openai-key" --prod
```

Verify variables:
```bash
npx convex env list --prod
```

### Vercel Setup (Option A: Two Projects)

#### Production Project
- [ ] Create project: `vercel --prod`
  - Project name: `franchiseen`
  - Connect to main branch
- [ ] Add domain: `franchiseen.com` and `www.franchiseen.com`
- [ ] Set environment variables (see `.env.mainnet.example`)
- [ ] Test build: Verify deployment succeeds
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active

#### Development Project
- [ ] Create branch: `git checkout -b devnet`
- [ ] Create project: `vercel --prod`
  - Project name: `franchiseen-devnet`
  - Connect to devnet branch
- [ ] Add domain: `dev.franchiseen.com`
- [ ] Set environment variables (see `.env.devnet.example`)
- [ ] Test build: Verify deployment succeeds

### DNS Configuration
- [ ] Configure production domain (franchiseen.com)
  ```
  Type    Name    Value
  A       @       76.76.21.21 (or Vercel IP)
  CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com
  ```
- [ ] Configure dev domain (dev.franchiseen.com)
  ```
  Type    Name    Value
  CNAME   dev     cname.vercel-dns.com
  ```
- [ ] Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)
- [ ] Verify both domains resolve correctly

---

## üîí Security Hardening

### Wallet Encryption
- [ ] Implement AES encryption in `convex/walletKeypairs.ts`
- [ ] Install crypto-js: `npm install crypto-js @types/crypto-js`
- [ ] Update `encryptSecretKey` function
- [ ] Update `decryptSecretKey` function
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption locally
- [ ] Deploy to both environments

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for sensitive mutations
- [ ] Test rate limits on devnet
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Transaction Validation
- [ ] Implement on-chain transaction verification
- [ ] Add validation before recording transactions
- [ ] Test on devnet
- [ ] Deploy to production

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Development Database (Devnet)
- [ ] Already populated with test data
- [ ] Verify test franchises exist
- [ ] Verify test users can access

### Production Database (Mainnet)
- [ ] Create `convex/seedProduction.ts`
- [ ] Seed admin accounts
- [ ] Seed master data (categories, etc.)
- [ ] Seed initial brands (if applicable)
- [ ] Run seed: `npx convex run seedProduction:seedProductionDatabase --prod`
- [ ] Verify data in Convex dashboard

---

## üí∞ Wallet Funding

### Development (Devnet - Free)
- [ ] Identify wallets that need funding
- [ ] Fund using faucet or CLI:
  ```bash
  solana airdrop 2 <WALLET_ADDRESS> --url devnet
  ```
- [ ] Verify balances in Solana Explorer (devnet)
- [ ] Test transactions

### Production (Mainnet - Real SOL)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Real money involved
- [ ] Create funding plan (which wallets, how much)
- [ ] Use secure wallet for transfers
- [ ] Fund incrementally (start with small amounts)
- [ ] Verify each transfer in Solana Explorer
- [ ] Document all funding transactions

---

## üß™ Testing Before Launch

### Devnet Testing (Complete Before Production)
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Brand registration and approval
- [ ] Franchise creation and approval
- [ ] Funding flow (PDA creation, token purchases)
- [ ] Wallet creation (franchise and brand wallets)
- [ ] Transaction execution (all three types)
- [ ] POS billing functionality
- [ ] Expense management
- [ ] Payout system
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] All user roles (admin, franchiser, franchise, investor)
- [ ] Error handling (network failures, insufficient funds, etc.)
- [ ] Verify transactions in Solana Explorer

### Production Smoke Tests (After Deployment)
