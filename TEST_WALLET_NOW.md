# üß™ Test Privy Wallet Now

## What I Fixed

1. **Added `useWallets` hook back** - But with client-side checks to avoid SSR errors
2. **Wait for wallets to be ready** - Sync happens when wallets are fully loaded
3. **Multiple fallbacks** - Checks wallets array, user.wallet, and linkedAccounts

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Open the App
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Log Out (if already logged in)
- Click your profile icon ‚Üí Sign Out
- This ensures a fresh login

### 3. Log In Again
- Click "Get Started"
- Log in with Google
- **Watch the browser console** for these logs:

**Expected Console Logs:**
```
User authenticated, syncing to Convex: {...}
Wallets ready: true Wallets: [{...}]
‚úÖ Privy Solana wallet found from wallets array: ABC123...XYZ789
Syncing user to Convex with wallet: ABC123...XYZ789
```

### 4. Check UserWallet Component
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/account`

**You should now see:**
```
Shawaz Sharif
ABC1...XYZ9   [copy icon]   REFRESH
```

Instead of:
```
Shawaz Sharif
Wallet not generated   REFRESH
```

### 5. Verify in Convex Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Open your project
3. Go to "Data" ‚Üí "users" table
4. Find your user
5. Check that `walletAddress` field has a value

## üêõ If Wallet Still Not Showing

### Check Console Logs

**If you see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No wallet found yet. Wallets ready: false Wallets count: 0
```

**Solution:** Wait a few seconds. Privy creates wallets asynchronously. The sync will run again when wallets become ready.

**If you see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No wallet found yet. Wallets ready: true Wallets count: 0
```

**Problem:** Privy didn't create a wallet. Check:
1. Privy dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Embedded Wallets ‚Üí Solana enabled?
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID is correct?

### Force Re-sync

If the wallet exists but isn't showing:

1. **Log out and log back in** - This triggers a fresh sync
2. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes old state is cached
3. **Check Convex dashboard** - See if walletAddress is there

## üìä What Happens Behind the Scenes

```
User logs in
    ‚Üì
Privy creates Solana wallet (async)
    ‚Üì
useWallets hook receives wallet
    ‚Üì
walletsReady = true
    ‚Üì
useEffect triggers syncUserToConvex
    ‚Üì
Wallet address synced to Convex
    ‚Üì
userProfile.walletAddress updated
    ‚Üì
UserWallet component shows wallet address
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Console shows wallet found logs
- [ ] UserWallet shows wallet address (not "Wallet not generated")
- [ ] Can copy wallet address
- [ ] Balance shows 0.0000 SOL (or actual balance if funded)
- [ ] Convex users table has walletAddress

## üîß Next: Fix Buy Token

Once the wallet is showing correctly, we'll fix the "Buy Token" functionality.
